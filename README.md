# 9 by 6 or 8 by 7

These are the assets for creating your own version of my project, 9 by 6 or 8 by 7. Change the sequence, the layout. Include different images (there are many outtakes here), include your own images. Include different drawings, write different words. Do what ever you want, in any format you want. This project is open source.

On desktop, you can download a ZIP file of these assets by clicking on the green Code button.
